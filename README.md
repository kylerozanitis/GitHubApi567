### This repo contains the homework assignment HW 04a: Develop with the Perspective of the Tester in mind ###

This assignment will require that you write code to interface with an external REST-based APIs.   We could have used almost any external APIs, but for this assignment we chose GitHub because many of its APIs are public and do not require any authorization or API Keys.   This simplifies both the use and setup.

For this assignment imagine that you have been asked to develop a function that will interface with GitHub in order to extract and present useful information to your user. The function will communicate using the RESTful services APIs provided by GitHub. The GitHub APIs will allow you to query for information about users, repositories, etc... which can be retrieved using the function, and then be displayed in the application.

What should make this assignment different from other programming assignments is in how you will approach it.  You should approach this assignment as a developer who more than anything else has the perspective of the tester in the front of your mind. 

The developer looks at the requirements and asks how should I design and implement this function, but the tester will ask questions such as what will I need to test for in this function?  And how will I test this function?   As you design and write the function as a developer, you should consider the perspective of the tester in any of your design and implementation decisions.
